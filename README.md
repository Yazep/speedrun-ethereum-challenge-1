# Decentralized Staking App Challenge Solution

git init This challenge was an exciting journey into Ethereum development, focusing on creating a decentralized application (Dapp) that enables users to stake ETH collaboratively. The task involved building a `Staker.sol` contract to collect ETH, tracking balances, and interacting with an `ExampleExternalContract` based on the collective staking outcome.

![Challenge Overview](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/a620999a-a1ff-462d-9ae3-5b49ab0e023a)

## What I Learned

While most of the application's codebase and setup were provided, diving into the challenge allowed me to:

- Understand the basics of üèó Scaffold-ETH 2 and smart contract development with Solidity.
- Utilize üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è HardHat for compiling and deploying smart contracts.
- Integrate smart contracts with a React frontend, employing essential Ethereum components and hooks.
- Deploy a functional Dapp on a public testnet, enabling real-world interaction with Ethereum blockchain.

## Challenges Solved

- **Smart Contract Development**: Developed the `Staker.sol` contract to manage ETH staking, including functionalities to stake, withdraw, and transfer funds based on collective user actions.
- **Frontend Integration**: Built and customized the frontend to interact seamlessly with the smart contract, providing users with an intuitive interface for staking ETH.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the smart contract and frontend to a testnet and a public web server, respectively, making the Dapp accessible to external users.

## Deployment

The final deliverable, a Dapp that allows users to participate in decentralized staking, is deployed and available for interaction. Users can stake ETH, and based on the collective action, funds are either sent to an external contract or returned.
